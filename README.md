# Data_Mining_2
Data Mining 2 Project

Target variables: vocal_channel, sex, emotional_intensity, emotion*

#TODO:
- Correlation Analysis for feature selection GIACOMO
- Normalization su training? SIMONE
- Imbalanced learning: subset BLERTA


# ANOMALY DET. 

1.	Depth-based Approaches --> Elliptic Envelope. Dovrebbe andare con dati normali.
2.	Deviation-based Approaches --> un metodo, fare quello 
3.	Distance-based Approaches --> KNN. 
4.	Density-based Approaches --> LOF
5.	Clustering-based Approaches --> DBSCAN 
6.	High-dimensional Approaches --> ABOD
7.	Ensemble-based Appraoches --> LODA
8.	Model-based Approaches --> isolation forest.
